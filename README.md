# reverse-factory
# Description
It's a mod for the game Factorio which add a new entity : the __Reverse Factory__.  
  
I based my work on the mod [__Recycling Plant__][recycling_plant].  
Therefore, the entity is still working as a furnace. Thereby, I take the decision to remove the property fuel_value of three items to allow them to be disassemble : __"wood"__, __"wooden-chest"__ and __"small-electric-pole"__  
  
The __Reverse Factory__ is a new version of the __Recycling Plant__ at the difference that every recipes of every mods are dynamically generated.  
   
Currently available and working for Factorio __0.12.1 AND superior__   
  
For basic mods, I can't garantee but there should be no problem to generate the recipes.  
But for big mods that's another matter.  
  
Tested mods :  
* Yuoki 0.2.31
* DyTech
  * CORE 1.2.0
  * Machine 1.1.0
  * Power 1.1.0
  * War 1.1.0
