# reverse-factory
# Description
It's a mod for the game Factorio which add a new entity : the Reverse Factory.  
  
I based my work on the mod "Recycling Plant".  
This mod gave the possibilty to disassemble all items of the vanilla's version of Factorio.  
The Reverse Factory is a new version of the Recycling Plant at the difference that every recipes are dynamically generated.  
   
Currently WIP for Factorio 0.12.1
