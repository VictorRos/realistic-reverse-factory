# realistic-reverse-factory
# Description
Mod for the game Factorio.  
  
Based on the work of Ricky Ford who implemented the mod "Recycling Plant".  
  
The Realistic Reverse Factory can disassemble any items in a realism purpose and get back the ressources you needed to create those items.  
  
It's "realistic" mod so you can't get back fluids if you needed fluids for the creation of the item you want to disassemble.
