# realistic-reverse-factory
Mod for the game Factorio.  
  
Based on the work of Ricky Ford who implemented the mod "Recycling Plant".  
  
The Realistic Reverse Factory can disassemble any items in a realism purpose and get back the ressources you needed to create those items.  
  
It's Realistic so you can't get back fluid if you needed a fluid item for the creation of the item you want to disassemble.
